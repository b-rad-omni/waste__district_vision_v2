# ==================== USAGE NOTES ==========================================
"""
OVERFITTING PREVENTION STRATEGY:
1. Start with these defaults
2. Monitor training vs validation loss closely  
3. If overfitting occurs:
   - Reduce mosaic to 0.5
   - Increase weight_decay to 0.001
   - Reduce lr0 to 0.005
   - Set patience to 5
   - Add dropout=0.1

MULTI-CAMERA OPTIMIZATION:
1. Increase copy_paste to 0.3 (cross-camera learning)
2. Increase hsv_v to 0.5 (lighting variations)
3. Keep degrees at 10 (slight camera angle differences)
4. Consider optimizer='AdamW' (better for complex data)

PERFORMANCE TUNING:
- If training is too slow: reduce imgsz to 1280 or 960
- If GPU memory issues: reduce batch size
- If validation mAP plateaus: try cos_lr=True
- If still overfitting: add dropout=0.1-0.2
